# GitHub Pages Starter

A minimal, no-build static site ready for GitHub Pages + Actions.

## Quick start

1. Create a new public repo named `<username>.github.io` (for a user/organization site) or any name for a project site.
2. Upload these files to the root of your repo and commit.
3. In your repo, go to **Settings → Pages** and ensure **Build and deployment** is set to **GitHub Actions**.
4. On your next push to `main`, the included workflow will publish your site.

- User/Org site URL: `https://<username>.github.io`
- Project site URL: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`

### Customize
- Edit `index.html` with your content.
- Tweak styles in `assets/style.css`.
- Add `CNAME` with your custom domain (optional) and set it in Settings → Pages.
